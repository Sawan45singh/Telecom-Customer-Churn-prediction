# Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction
 • Use of a machine learning model helped predict the likelihood of churn for customers in a telecom company.
 Performed exploratory analyzing data (EDA) to uncover important reasons behind churn.
 • Tried classifying the data using Decision Tree, Random Forest and similar algorithms, making the process
 better measuring performance based on precision, recall and confusion matrix.
 • I managed class imbalance by using the SMOTE technique.
 • Exported the final model using Flask to allow users to predict churn instantly through a web page.
